##Event Tracker

#Overview

In week eleven of Skill Distillery, we were assigned to complete a project implementing SpringRest, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON and AJAX. The project had to follow the theme of an 'Event Tracker.'

#Project Objectives

'Event Tracker' is a broad term for anything that keeps track of information over time. I chose to create a Dog Walking Tracker that takes in information about a pet owner's Dog, distance walked, length of time walked and location where the walk took place.


The following criteria needed to be met for a passing grade:
Configure a full stack SpringREST app
model a simple Java object and store it in a single table database
use restful annotations
Send / receive JSON
Parse JSON response with JavaScript
Build HTML (using JSON) with jQuery
Send asynchronous request to Java controller with jQuery's AJAX


A new event object implements full CRUD.
All interactions with the database are done so RESTfully.
App uses jQuery to access data and manipulate the DOM.
App presents the aggregated data in some additional format.

#Project Limitations and Areas For Improvement

The project was undertaken in the scope of a weekend and for that reason, a few changes or improvements could make this program even better. I would have liked to present more meaningful statistical information however in my initial design, I did not build the program to record dates or other such data (useful in grouping walks by weekly or monthly increments). Another practical feature would be to add a secured registration and login for individual use.
