Event Tracker

#Overview

In week eleven of Skill Distillery, we were assigned to complete a project implementing SpringRest, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON and AJAX. The project had to follow a theme of 'Event Tracker.'

#Project Objectives

'Event Tracker' is a broad term for anything that keeps track of information over time. I chose to create a Dog Walking Tracker that takes in information about a pet owner's Dog, distance walked, length of time walked and location where the walk took place.


The following criteria needed to be met for a passing grade:
+Configure a full stack SpringREST app
+model a simple Java object and store it in a single table database
+use restful annotations
+Send / receive JSON
+Parse JSON response with JavaScript
+Build HTML (using JSON) with jQuery
+Send asynchronous request to Java controller with jQuery's AJAX


+A new event object implements full CRUD.
+All interactions with the database are done so RESTfully.
+App uses jQuery to access data and manipulate the DOM.
+App presents the aggregated data in some additional format.
